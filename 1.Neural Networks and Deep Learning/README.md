# Neural Networks and Deep Learning
These are the jupyter notebook asignments for the course Neural Networks and Deep Learning offered by Coursera and authored by DeeplearniNG.ai

## 1. Python Basics with numpy.

Welcome to your first programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. In this assignment you will:

- Learn how to use numpy.

- Implement some basic core deep learning functions such as the softmax, sigmoid, dsigmoid, etc...

- Learn how to handle data by normalizing inputs and reshaping images.

- Recognize the importance of vectorization.

- Understand how python broadcasting works.


## 2. Logistic Regression with a Neural Network mindset.

Welcome to the first (required) programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. In this notebook you will build your first image recognition algorithm. You will build a cat classifier that recognizes cats with 70% accuracy!

As you keep learning new techniques you will increase it to 80+ % accuracy on cat vs. non-cat datasets. By completing this assignment you will:

- Work with logistic regression in a way that builds intuition relevant to neural networks.

- Learn how to minimize the cost function.

- Understand how derivatives of the cost are used to update parameters.

## 3. Planar data classification with a hidden layer.

Welcome to the second programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. In this notebook you will generate red and blue points to form a flower. You will then fit a neural network to correctly classify the points. You will try different layers and see the results

By completing this assignment you will:

- Develop an intuition of back-propagation and see it work on data.

- Recognize that the more hidden layers you have the more complex structure you could capture.

- Build all the helper functions to implement a full model with one hidden layer.

## 4. Building your Deep Neural Network: Step by Step.

Welcome to your third programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. You will implement all the building blocks of a neural network and use these building blocks in the next assignment to build a neural network of any architecture you want. By completing this assignment you will:

- Develop an intuition of the over all structure of a neural network.

- Write functions (e.g. forward propagation, backward propagation, logistic loss, etc...) that would help you decompose your code and ease the process of building a neural network.

- Initialize/update parameters according to your desired structure.

## 5. Deep Neural Network - Application.

Congratulations! Welcome to the fourth programming exercise of the deep learning specialization. You will now use everything you have learned to build a deep neural network that classifies *cat vs. non-cat images*.
